# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement comprehensive end-to-end testing using Playwright to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and enable confident deployment of the AI D&D platform. The tests will provide developers with automated verification of core functionality and catch bugs before they reach production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to push code that is secure and bug-free, so that I can maintain high quality standards and user trust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN automated tests SHALL run and verify core functionality
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the deployment pipeline SHALL be blocked until issues are resolved
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN tests SHALL flag them before production
4. WHEN performance regressions occur THEN tests SHALL catch them during CI/CD
5. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN tests SHALL identify affected functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have tests to verify new functionality, so that I can ensure features work as intended before release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are developed THEN corresponding tests SHALL be created to verify behavior
2. WHEN character creation is modified THEN tests SHALL verify the complete flow works correctly
3. WHEN AI integration changes THEN tests SHALL verify DM interactions still function
4. WHEN UI components are updated THEN tests SHALL verify user interactions remain functional
5. WHEN API endpoints change THEN tests SHALL verify data flow and error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure when a bug is fixed it stays fixed, so that I can prevent regression issues from reoccurring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bug is identified and fixed THEN a regression test SHALL be added to prevent recurrence
2. WHEN game state corruption occurs THEN tests SHALL verify data integrity is maintained
3. WHEN AI service failures happen THEN tests SHALL verify fallback mechanisms work
4. WHEN cross-platform issues arise THEN tests SHALL verify fixes work on all platforms
5. WHEN performance issues are resolved THEN tests SHALL monitor for performance regressions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated verification of critical user journeys, so that I can ensure the core game experience remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create new characters THEN tests SHALL verify the complete character creation flow
2. WHEN users continue existing games THEN tests SHALL verify saved game loading and restoration
3. WHEN users interact with the DM THEN tests SHALL verify chat functionality and AI responses
4. WHEN users access character sheets THEN tests SHALL verify data display and modification
5. WHEN users perform dice rolls THEN tests SHALL verify game mechanics and result handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling verification, so that I can ensure the app gracefully handles failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN tests SHALL verify fallback responses are provided
2. WHEN network connectivity fails THEN tests SHALL verify offline functionality and recovery
3. WHEN invalid user input occurs THEN tests SHALL verify proper validation and error messages
4. WHEN storage operations fail THEN tests SHALL verify data recovery and user notification
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN tests SHALL verify logging and graceful degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform compatibility testing, so that I can ensure consistent functionality across all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run on web browsers THEN all core functionality SHALL be verified across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. WHEN tests run on mobile viewports THEN touch interactions and responsive design SHALL be verified
3. WHEN platform-specific features are tested THEN graceful degradation SHALL be verified on unsupported platforms
4. WHEN different screen sizes are tested THEN UI adaptability SHALL be verified
5. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN compliance with WCAG guidelines SHALL be verified

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and reliability testing, so that I can ensure the app meets quality standards under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page load performance is tested THEN initial load times SHALL be under 3 seconds
2. WHEN AI response times are tested THEN they SHALL complete within acceptable timeframes
3. WHEN memory usage is tested THEN it SHALL remain within defined limits during extended gameplay
4. WHEN concurrent user scenarios are tested THEN the app SHALL handle multiple sessions correctly
5. WHEN stress testing is performed THEN the app SHALL maintain functionality under load

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data persistence and state management testing, so that I can ensure game progress is reliably saved and restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game state changes occur THEN tests SHALL verify automatic saving functionality
2. WHEN the app is restarted THEN tests SHALL verify complete state restoration
3. WHEN data migration occurs THEN tests SHALL verify backward compatibility
4. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN tests SHALL verify cleanup and management
5. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN tests SHALL verify recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want voice and accessibility feature testing, so that I can ensure inclusive functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text-to-speech features are tested THEN audio output SHALL be verified programmatically
2. WHEN voice recognition is tested THEN speech-to-text conversion SHALL be verified
3. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN screen reader compatibility SHALL be verified
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is tested THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible without mouse
5. WHEN high contrast modes are tested THEN visual accessibility SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous integration testing, so that I can maintain code quality throughout the development lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN tests SHALL run automatically and report results
2. WHEN tests fail THEN detailed reports SHALL be provided with failure reasons and screenshots
3. WHEN tests pass THEN deployment SHALL be automatically approved for staging environments
4. WHEN nightly builds run THEN comprehensive test suites SHALL verify system stability
5. WHEN test coverage drops THEN alerts SHALL be generated to maintain quality standards
