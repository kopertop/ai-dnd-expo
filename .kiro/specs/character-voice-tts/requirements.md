# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a local, offline text-to-speech system that assigns unique, consistent voices to each character in the D&D game. The system ensures that each character (player characters, NPCs, and AI companions) maintains the same voice throughout the entire game session and across multiple sessions. The solution must work entirely offline without requiring cloud-based services, leveraging local TTS engines and potentially integrating with the existing ONNX-based Cactus local development system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want each character in my D&D game to have a unique voice, so that I can easily distinguish between different speakers during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new character is introduced to the game THEN the system SHALL assign a unique voice profile to that character
2. WHEN multiple characters are speaking THEN each character SHALL have a distinctly different voice
3. WHEN the same character speaks multiple times THEN the character SHALL maintain the exact same voice profile
4. IF all available voice profiles are assigned THEN the system SHALL intelligently reuse voices while minimizing conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want character voices to remain consistent across game sessions, so that I maintain immersion and character recognition over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save and reload a game session THEN each character SHALL retain their previously assigned voice
2. WHEN I start a new session with existing characters THEN those characters SHALL use their established voice profiles
3. WHEN character voice assignments are stored THEN the system SHALL persist voice mappings locally
4. IF voice data becomes corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully reassign voices while notifying the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the text-to-speech system to work completely offline, so that I can play D&D anywhere without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device has no internet connection THEN the TTS system SHALL function normally
2. WHEN the app starts for the first time THEN all required TTS engines and voice data SHALL be available locally
3. WHEN generating speech THEN the system SHALL NOT make any network requests
4. IF local TTS resources are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want high-quality, natural-sounding voices for characters, so that the audio experience enhances rather than detracts from gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is converted to speech THEN the output SHALL sound natural and clear
2. WHEN characters speak dialogue THEN the speech SHALL have appropriate pacing and intonation
3. WHEN the system processes text THEN it SHALL handle punctuation, abbreviations, and D&D terminology correctly
4. IF multiple TTS engines are available THEN the system SHALL use the highest quality option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TTS system to integrate seamlessly with our existing Cactus ONNX local system, so that we maintain architectural consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TTS system is implemented THEN it SHALL leverage existing ONNX infrastructure where applicable
2. WHEN voice processing occurs THEN it SHALL use similar patterns to other local AI services
3. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing AI service manager
4. IF ONNX-based TTS models are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize their use over platform TTS

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to customize voice assignments for characters, so that I can optimize the audio experience for my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access character settings THEN I SHALL be able to preview and change voice assignments
2. WHEN I change a character's voice THEN the new voice SHALL be used for all future speech from that character
3. WHEN I preview voices THEN I SHALL hear sample speech in each available voice
4. IF I reset voice assignments THEN the system SHALL reassign voices automatically while maintaining uniqueness

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the TTS system to perform efficiently on mobile devices, so that it doesn't impact game performance or battery life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS is processing text THEN it SHALL NOT cause noticeable lag in the game interface
2. WHEN multiple characters speak in sequence THEN speech generation SHALL be optimized to minimize delays
3. WHEN the device is under memory pressure THEN the TTS system SHALL manage resources efficiently
4. IF TTS processing is intensive THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust quality vs performance
