# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to achieve 100% unit test coverage for the AI D&D Platform using Vitest as the testing framework. The testing strategy will focus on comprehensive unit testing of all components, hooks, services, and utilities while mocking external APIs and dependencies to ensure isolated, fast, and reliable tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit test coverage so that I can confidently refactor and extend the codebase without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL achieve 100% line coverage across all testable code
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL achieve 100% branch coverage for all conditional logic
3. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL achieve 100% function coverage for all exported functions
4. WHEN external APIs are called in tests THEN the system SHALL use mocks instead of real API calls
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for the full suite

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components to be thoroughly tested so that UI behavior is predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is rendered THEN the test SHALL verify it renders without crashing
2. WHEN a component receives props THEN the test SHALL verify it displays the correct content
3. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the test SHALL verify the correct callbacks are triggered
4. WHEN component state changes THEN the test SHALL verify the UI updates appropriately
5. WHEN components use hooks THEN the hooks SHALL be mocked or tested in isolation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all custom hooks to be tested so that state management logic is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hook is called THEN the test SHALL verify it returns the expected initial state
2. WHEN hook actions are triggered THEN the test SHALL verify state updates correctly
3. WHEN hooks have side effects THEN the test SHALL verify effects are triggered appropriately
4. WHEN hooks depend on external services THEN those services SHALL be mocked
5. WHEN hooks handle errors THEN the test SHALL verify error states are managed correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service classes and utilities to be tested so that business logic is thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods are called THEN the test SHALL verify they return expected results
2. WHEN services make external API calls THEN those calls SHALL be mocked
3. WHEN services handle errors THEN the test SHALL verify error handling behavior
4. WHEN utility functions are called THEN the test SHALL verify they produce correct outputs
5. WHEN services have configuration THEN the test SHALL verify different configurations work correctly
6. WHEN external APIs are called THEN mocks SHALL be used so tests remain fast, but internal functions SHALL NOT be mocked to ensure full internal code coverage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test infrastructure that supports efficient testing workflows so that testing doesn't slow down development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL use Vitest as the testing framework
2. WHEN external dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be mocked using Vitest's mocking capabilities
3. WHEN tests need test data THEN they SHALL use factories or fixtures for consistent data
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL provide clear coverage reports showing uncovered lines
5. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what went wrong

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be maintainable and follow consistent patterns so that the test suite remains valuable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and structure
2. WHEN testing similar functionality THEN tests SHALL use shared utilities and helpers
3. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN mocks SHALL be reusable across multiple test files
4. WHEN tests become complex THEN they SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused test cases
5. WHEN test setup is needed THEN it SHALL be handled in beforeEach/beforeAll hooks appropriately
