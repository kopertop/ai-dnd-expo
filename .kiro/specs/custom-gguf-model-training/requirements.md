# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the AI D&D platform to train custom GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) models specifically optimized for D&D gameplay. The system will provide a framework for fine-tuning existing models (like Gemma or Qwen) with D&D-specific training data, including system prompts, character interactions, and tool usage patterns. The trained models will be compatible with the local Cactus agent infrastructure and support the platform's tool calling format for game mechanics like dice rolls and health management.
