# Design Document: Custom GGUF Model Training

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and components for implementing a custom GGUF model training system for the AI D&D platform. The primary goal is to provide a **single command solution** (`pnpm run train`) that automatically handles the entire process from dependency installation to generating a ready-to-use GGUF model for the CactusTTS system.

The system will enable developers to fine-tune existing language models (specifically Gemma3n) with D&D-specific data, creating optimized models that understand game mechanics, character interactions, and tool usage patterns. The entire process will be fully automated, requiring no manual intervention, and will output the exact modelPath and mmprojPath configuration needed for seamless integration with the existing cactus.ts infrastructure.

## Architecture

The custom GGUF model training system follows a command-driven architecture centered around the `pnpm run train` command. The system is designed for complete automation with the following key components:

## Data Models

### Training Data Structure

The training data will be organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
training_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ combat/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ basic_combat.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ complex_combat.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ roleplay/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tavern_interaction.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ quest_negotiation.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ exploration/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dungeon_exploration.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wilderness_travel.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Markdown Scenario Format

Each markdown scenario will follow a structured format:

```markdown
# SYSTEM
Role: Dungeon Master
World: Forgotten Realms
Location: Tavern
Party:
- Thordak (Dragonborn Fighter, Level 5, HP: 45/45)
- Elara (Elf Wizard, Level 5, HP: 28/28)
- Grimm (Dwarf Cleric, Level 5, HP: 38/38)

# CONVERSATION
## User
I want to approach the bartender and ask about rumors in town.

## DM
The burly half-orc bartender looks up as you approach. "What'll it be?" he grunts, wiping a mug with a questionably clean rag.

When you ask about rumors, he leans in closer. "Well, there's been talk of strange lights in the old tower north of town. Some say it's ghosts, others say it's that crazy wizard Zandor up to no good again."

He eyes you up and down. "You lot look capable. Thinking of checking it out? Might want to test your perception first."

[roll: perception]

## TOOLCALL
perception: 15 + 10(skill) = *25*

## DM
With your keen awareness, you notice a hooded figure in the corner of the tavern who seems to be listening intently to your conversation. They quickly look away when they realize you've spotted them.

The bartender continues, "If you're heading to the tower, be careful. Last fellow who went there came back babbling nonsense about living statues."
```

### Training Configuration

The training configuration will be stored as a Python dictionary:

```python
training_config = {
    "base_model": "gemma-3-2b-it",
    "learning_rate": 1e-5,
    "batch_size": 4,
    "epochs": 3,
    "max_seq_length": 2048,
    "warmup_steps": 100,
    "weight_decay": 0.01,
    "quantization": "Q4_K_M",
    "output_dir": "trained_models/dnd_gemma_3b",
    "checkpoint_interval": 500
}
```

### Model Metadata

The model metadata will be stored as a JSON file:

```json
{
  "model_name": "dnd_gemma_3b_gguf",
  "base_model": "gemma-3-2b-it",
  "training_date": "2025-07-21",
  "training_steps": 1500,
  "final_loss": 0.0823,
  "validation_accuracy": 0.912,
  "tool_call_accuracy": 0.945,
  "quantization_level": "Q4_K_M",
  "file_size_mb": 1850,
  "compatible_platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "Android"],
  "recommended_context_length": 2048,
  "supported_tools": ["roll", "health", "inventory", "spellcast", "check"]
}
```

## Error Handling

The system will implement comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth training experience:

1. **Environment Setup Errors**
   - Dependency installation failures
   - Hardware compatibility issues
   - Python version mismatches

2. **Data Processing Errors**
   - Malformed markdown files
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid tool call syntax

3. **Training Errors**
   - Out of memory errors
   - Model loading failures
   - Training divergence

4. **Export Errors**
   - Conversion failures
   - Size limit violations
   - Compatibility issues

Each error will be caught, logged with detailed information, and presented with actionable recovery suggestions.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the custom GGUF model training system includes:

### Unit Testing

- Test individual components (DataProcessor, ModelTrainer, etc.)
- Validate parsing logic for markdown scenarios
- Verify tool call extraction and formatting

### Integration Testing

Each phase will be implemented to work seamlessly with the `pnpm run train` command, ensuring the primary requirement of single-command automation is met.

## CactusTTS Integration Requirements

The system must ensure seamless integration with the existing CactusTTS infrastructure:

### Model Compatibility
- **Format**: GGUF format compatible with Cactus compute network
- **Size**: Optimized for mobile deployment (< 2GB recommended)
- **Quantization**: Q4_K_M or similar for optimal performance/size balance
- **Context Length**: 2048 tokens minimum for D&D scenarios

### Tool Calling Format
The trained model must support the existing tool calling format used in the D&D platform:
```
[roll: perception] -> <TOOLCALL>perception: 15 + 10(skill) = *25*</TOOLCALL>
[health: player, -5] -> <TOOLCALL>health: player health reduced by 5</TOOLCALL>
```

### Integration Points
1. **cactus.ts Configuration**:
   ```typescript
   modelPath: "./assets/models/custom-dnd-gemma3n.gguf"
   mmprojPath: "./assets/models/custom-dnd-gemma3n-mmproj.gguf" // if needed
   ```

2. **local-dm-agent.ts Compatibility**:
   - Must work with existing agent initialization
   - Support for D&D-specific system prompts
   - Compatible with current message handling

3. **File Structure**:
   ```
   assets/models/
   â”œâ”€â”€ custom-dnd-gemma3n.gguf
   â”œâ”€â”€ custom-dnd-gemma3n-mmproj.gguf (optional)
   â””â”€â”€ model-metadata.json
   ```

### Validation Requirements
- Automatic testing against existing D&D scenarios
- Validation of tool call parsing and execution
- Performance benchmarking against current models
- Memory usage validation for mobile deployment

## Conclusion
