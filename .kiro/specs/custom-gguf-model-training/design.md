# Design Document: Custom GGUF Model Training

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and components for implementing a custom GGUF model training system for the AI D&D platform. The system will enable developers to fine-tune existing language models with D&D-specific data, creating optimized models that understand game mechanics, character interactions, and tool usage patterns. The entire training process will run within a Jupyter notebook environment on macOS, making it accessible to developers without requiring specialized infrastructure.

## Architecture

The custom GGUF model training system follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

## Data Models

### Training Data Structure

The training data will be organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
training_data/
├── combat/
│   ├── basic_combat.md
│   ├── complex_combat.md
│   └── ...
├── roleplay/
│   ├── tavern_interaction.md
│   ├── quest_negotiation.md
│   └── ...
├── exploration/
│   ├── dungeon_exploration.md
│   ├── wilderness_travel.md
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Markdown Scenario Format

Each markdown scenario will follow a structured format:

```markdown
# SYSTEM
Role: Dungeon Master
World: Forgotten Realms
Location: Tavern
Party:
- Thordak (Dragonborn Fighter, Level 5, HP: 45/45)
- Elara (Elf Wizard, Level 5, HP: 28/28)
- Grimm (Dwarf Cleric, Level 5, HP: 38/38)

# CONVERSATION
## User
I want to approach the bartender and ask about rumors in town.

## DM
The burly half-orc bartender looks up as you approach. "What'll it be?" he grunts, wiping a mug with a questionably clean rag.

When you ask about rumors, he leans in closer. "Well, there's been talk of strange lights in the old tower north of town. Some say it's ghosts, others say it's that crazy wizard Zandor up to no good again."

He eyes you up and down. "You lot look capable. Thinking of checking it out? Might want to test your perception first."

[roll: perception]

## TOOLCALL
perception: 15 + 10(skill) = *25*

## DM
With your keen awareness, you notice a hooded figure in the corner of the tavern who seems to be listening intently to your conversation. They quickly look away when they realize you've spotted them.

The bartender continues, "If you're heading to the tower, be careful. Last fellow who went there came back babbling nonsense about living statues."
```

### Training Configuration

The training configuration will be stored as a Python dictionary:

```python
training_config = {
    "base_model": "gemma-3-2b-it",
    "learning_rate": 1e-5,
    "batch_size": 4,
    "epochs": 3,
    "max_seq_length": 2048,
    "warmup_steps": 100,
    "weight_decay": 0.01,
    "quantization": "Q4_K_M",
    "output_dir": "trained_models/dnd_gemma_3b",
    "checkpoint_interval": 500
}
```

### Model Metadata

The model metadata will be stored as a JSON file:

```json
{
  "model_name": "dnd_gemma_3b_gguf",
  "base_model": "gemma-3-2b-it",
  "training_date": "2025-07-21",
  "training_steps": 1500,
  "final_loss": 0.0823,
  "validation_accuracy": 0.912,
  "tool_call_accuracy": 0.945,
  "quantization_level": "Q4_K_M",
  "file_size_mb": 1850,
  "compatible_platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "Android"],
  "recommended_context_length": 2048,
  "supported_tools": ["roll", "health", "inventory", "spellcast", "check"]
}
```

## Error Handling

The system will implement comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth training experience:

1. **Environment Setup Errors**
   - Dependency installation failures
   - Hardware compatibility issues
   - Python version mismatches

2. **Data Processing Errors**
   - Malformed markdown files
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid tool call syntax

3. **Training Errors**
   - Out of memory errors
   - Model loading failures
   - Training divergence

4. **Export Errors**
   - Conversion failures
   - Size limit violations
   - Compatibility issues

Each error will be caught, logged with detailed information, and presented with actionable recovery suggestions.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the custom GGUF model training system includes:

### Unit Testing

- Test individual components (DataProcessor, ModelTrainer, etc.)
- Validate parsing logic for markdown scenarios
- Verify tool call extraction and formatting

### Integration Testing

- Test end-to-end training pipeline with small datasets
- Verify model loading, training, and export processes
- Validate integration between components

### Validation Testing

- Evaluate trained models on D&D-specific scenarios
- Test tool call accuracy and response quality
- Compare performance with baseline models

### Performance Testing

- Measure training speed and resource usage
- Evaluate inference performance on different hardware
- Test model size optimization techniques

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow these phases:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create Jupyter notebook structure
   - Implement dependency management
   - Add hardware detection and configuration

2. **Data Processing**
   - Implement markdown parsing
   - Create data preprocessing pipeline
   - Add validation and augmentation features

   - Implement validation framework
   - Create metrics calculation
   - Add comparison with baseline

5. **Model Export**
   - Implement GGUF conversion

   - Create Cactus integration utilities

Each phase will be implemented as a separate section in the Jupyter notebook, allowing developers to execute the process step by step.

## Conclusion

This design provides a comprehensive framework for implementing a custom GGUF model training system for the AI D&D platform. By running entirely within a Jupyter notebook on macOS, the system will be accessible to developers without requiring specialized infrastructure. The modular architecture allows for flexibility and extensibility, while the structured data format ensures consistent training results.
