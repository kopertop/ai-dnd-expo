# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements responsive layouts for the AI D&D game application, optimizing the user experience across different device sizes. Specifically, it creates distinct views for tablet and phone (small screen) devices. For phones, the interface will use a tab-based navigation system to manage limited screen real estate. For tablets, the interface will leverage the larger screen with a side-by-side layout that shows multiple game elements simultaneously. Additionally, the feature includes voice-interactive chat capabilities to enhance the immersive experience across all device types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile player using a phone, I want a tab-based interface that lets me easily switch between game views, so that I can have a good experience despite limited screen space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application detects a phone-sized screen THEN the system SHALL display a tab-based navigation interface.
2. WHEN the tab interface is active THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for at least: Chat, Character Sheet, Map/Game View, and Settings.
3. WHEN a user taps on a tab THEN the system SHALL switch to the corresponding view while maintaining game state.
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of each view.
5. WHEN in the Chat tab THEN the system SHALL display the full DM chat interface optimized for the phone screen size.
6. WHEN in the Character Sheet tab THEN the system SHALL display the character information in a scrollable, phone-optimized format.
7. WHEN in the Map/Game View tab THEN the system SHALL display the game map or current scene visualization.
8. WHEN in the Settings tab THEN the system SHALL display game settings and configuration options.
9. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout while maintaining the tab structure.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tablet user, I want a side-by-side layout that shows multiple game elements simultaneously, so that I can take advantage of the larger screen real estate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application detects a tablet-sized screen THEN the system SHALL display a side-by-side layout.
2. WHEN the tablet layout is active THEN the system SHALL display the Chat interface on the left side of the screen.
3. WHEN the tablet layout is active THEN the system SHALL display the Game Map/View on the right side of the screen.
4. WHEN the tablet layout is active THEN the system SHALL provide easily accessible buttons at the bottom of the screen for Character Sheet and Settings.
5. WHEN a user taps the Character Sheet button THEN the system SHALL display the character sheet as a modal or panel without fully leaving the main game view.
6. WHEN a user taps the Settings button THEN the system SHALL display settings as a modal or panel without fully leaving the main game view.
7. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the side-by-side proportions appropriately.
8. IF the tablet is in portrait orientation THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout to maintain usability (possibly stacking components vertically).

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the application to automatically detect my device type and present the appropriate interface, so that I don't have to manually configure the layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect the device screen size and type.
2. WHEN the device is detected as a phone THEN the system SHALL automatically use the tab-based interface.
3. WHEN the device is detected as a tablet THEN the system SHALL automatically use the side-by-side layout.
4. WHEN the screen size or orientation changes THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate and adjust the interface if necessary.
5. IF the device falls into an edge case between phone and tablet sizes THEN the system SHALL use reasonable breakpoints to determine the appropriate layout.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the responsive layouts to use existing components and hooks where possible, so that we maintain code consistency and minimize duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL reuse existing game components rather than duplicating functionality.
2. WHEN implementing responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL use React Native's responsive design capabilities.
3. WHEN detecting device type THEN the system SHALL use the existing `use-screen-size` hook or similar utilities.
4. WHEN implementing the tab interface THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing navigation system.
5. WHEN implementing either layout THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing game functionality.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth transitions between different views and layouts, so that the game experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between tabs on phone layout THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations for tab transitions.
2. WHEN opening modals or panels in tablet layout THEN the system SHALL animate their appearance and disappearance.
3. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the new layout.
4. WHEN the layout changes due to device detection THEN the system SHALL ensure no jarring visual changes occur.
5. WHEN any transition occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain game state and context.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want the chat interface to speak responses and transcribe my voice input automatically, so I can have a hands-free, immersive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system outputs chat from the DM or other characters THEN the system SHALL speak it aloud using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
2. WHEN implementing TTS THEN the system SHALL configure voice parameters (pitch, rate) and handle speech events for start/finish/cancel.
3. WHEN the user taps a mic button in Chat THEN the system SHALL start real-time voice transcription via Speech-to-Text (STT).
4. WHEN the user is speaking THEN the system SHALL transcribe as the user speaks and populate the chat input automatically.
5. WHEN the user stops or pauses speaking THEN the system SHALL display the final transcription in the input for confirmation before sending.
6. WHEN implementing the Chat UI THEN the system SHALL provide a mic toggle button.
7. WHEN implementing voice features THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with game state (e.g., utterances queued properly).
8. WHEN implementing voice features THEN the system SHALL support both Android & iOS platforms.
9. WHEN implementing voice features THEN the system SHALL handle required permissions: Android RECORD_AUDIO; iOS mic + speech recognition.
10. WHEN errors occur during voice interactions THEN the system SHALL handle errors/events gracefully and show UI states for listening, errors, and stopping.
11. WHEN implementing voice features THEN the system SHALL ensure they adapt in both phone (tab view) and tablet (side-by-side) layouts without layout breakage.
12. WHEN orientation changes or layout switches THEN the system SHALL ensure active speech sessions continue or pause cleanly.
13. WHEN starting/stopping voice input and TTS THEN the system SHALL animate appropriately.
14. WHEN voice interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain game context throughout the interactions.
