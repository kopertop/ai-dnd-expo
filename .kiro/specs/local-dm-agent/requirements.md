# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables a Dungeon Master (DM) Agent that can run entirely on-device using a local Gemma3 language model on iOS and iPadOS devices. The local DM agent provides intelligent D&D gameplay assistance without requiring internet connectivity, ensuring privacy and enabling gameplay in offline scenarios. This addresses the need for reliable AI-powered D&D experiences that don't depend on external services or network availability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to use an AI Dungeon Master that runs locally on my iPhone or iPad, so that I can play D&D without internet connectivity and with complete privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a new game THEN the system SHALL initialize the local Gemma3 model on the device
2. WHEN the local model is loading THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with estimated completion time
3. WHEN the local model fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and fallback options
4. WHEN the device has insufficient memory THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the limitation and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the local DM agent to generate contextually appropriate responses and story content, so that I have an engaging gameplay experience comparable to cloud-based AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player takes an action THEN the local DM agent SHALL generate a response within 10 seconds
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the local DM agent SHALL maintain consistency with the current game state and story context
3. WHEN the player asks questions about rules THEN the local DM agent SHALL provide accurate D&D 5e rule interpretations
4. WHEN combat occurs THEN the local DM agent SHALL properly manage initiative, damage calculations, and status effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile device user, I want the local DM agent to efficiently manage device resources, so that my device remains responsive and battery life is preserved during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local DM agent is running THEN the system SHALL monitor and limit CPU usage to prevent device overheating
2. WHEN the device battery is below 20% THEN the system SHALL offer to reduce model complexity or switch to power-saving mode
3. WHEN other apps need memory THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce the model's memory footprint
4. WHEN the device is idle for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL pause model processing to conserve battery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want seamless integration between the local DM agent and existing game features, so that I can use all app functionality regardless of connectivity status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the local DM agent THEN the system SHALL maintain full access to character sheets, inventory, and game state
2. WHEN switching between local and cloud AI THEN the system SHALL preserve game continuity and context
3. WHEN voice features are enabled THEN the local DM agent SHALL integrate with text-to-speech functionality
4. WHEN generating content THEN the local DM agent SHALL work with the existing world generation and location systems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want all DM agent processing to occur locally on my device, so that my gameplay data and conversations remain completely private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the local DM agent THEN the system SHALL NOT transmit any gameplay data to external servers
2. WHEN the model processes user input THEN all computation SHALL occur entirely on the local device
3. WHEN game data is saved THEN all information SHALL be stored locally using device encryption
4. WHEN the user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove all local model data and game history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want the local DM agent to have intelligent fallback mechanisms, so that gameplay can continue even if the local model encounters issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local model fails during gameplay THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to rule-based responses
2. WHEN model responses are taking too long THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling with alternative options
3. WHEN the model produces inappropriate content THEN the system SHALL filter responses and regenerate when necessary
4. WHEN the local model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL offer to switch to cloud-based AI if connectivity is available
