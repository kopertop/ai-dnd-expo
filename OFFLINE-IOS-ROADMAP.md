# Offline iOS D&D Game - Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status: 🟡 Partially Complete

The migration to Callstack Incubator AI is complete, but critical implementation gaps prevent offline iOS functionality.

## Your Requirements Analysis

### ✅ Requirements Met
1. **Mobile-First Architecture**: React Native + Expo with iOS focus
2. **Voice Framework**: iOS Speech Recognition and TTS hooks implemented
3. **AI Architecture**: Fallback system designed (Cactus → Local → Rule-based)
4. **Game Logic**: D&D mechanics and character system in place

### ❌ Critical Gaps for Offline iOS
1. **Local AI Models**: ONNX models not integrated/working
2. **TypeScript Errors**: 100+ compilation errors blocking builds
3. **Voice Offline**: Speech recognition needs native iOS implementation
4. **Model Storage**: No local model download/management system

## Implementation Priority (for Offline iOS)

### Phase 1: Fix Compilation (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors (100+ errors)
- [ ] Implement missing AI service interfaces
- [ ] Fix test suite compatibility
- [ ] Ensure iOS builds work

### Phase 2: Local AI Implementation (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Integrate working ONNX models for iOS
- [ ] Implement model quantization for mobile
- [ ] Add model download/caching system
- [ ] Test local inference performance on iOS

### Phase 3: Native iOS Voice (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Replace expo-speech-recognition with native iOS Speech Framework
- [ ] Implement offline speech-to-text
- [ ] Optimize for iOS battery usage
- [ ] Add voice activity detection

### Phase 4: Offline Game Loop (ESSENTIAL)
- [ ] Ensure complete offline gameplay
- [ ] Test voice-only interaction flow
- [ ] Optimize for iPad/iPhone screens
- [ ] Add offline data persistence

## Technical Recommendations

### For Local AI (iOS Offline)
```typescript
// Use react-native-ai with MLC-LLM for iOS
import { getModel, downloadModel } from '@react-native-ai/mlc';

// Download Gemma-3-2B quantized for iOS
const model = await downloadModel('gemma-3-2b-int4-ios');
```

### For Native iOS Speech
```typescript
// Replace expo-speech-recognition with native iOS
import { SpeechRecognition } from 'react-native-speech-recognition';

// Use on-device recognition
const result = await SpeechRecognition.start({
  requiresOnDeviceRecognition: true,
  continuous: true
});
```

### For Voice-Powered Gameplay
```typescript
// Voice-first game loop
const handleVoiceInput = async (transcript: string) => {
  // 1. Process with local AI
  const dmResponse = await localAI.generateResponse(transcript);
  
  // 2. Update game state
  updateGameState(dmResponse.actions);
  
  // 3. Speak response
  await textToSpeech.speak(dmResponse.narrative);
};
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix TypeScript errors first** - Nothing works until compilation succeeds
2. **Implement working local AI** - Core requirement for offline play
3. **Test on actual iOS device** - Ensure performance meets requirements
4. **Optimize for voice-only interaction** - Your unique requirement

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Fix Compilation)**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 2 (Local AI)**: 3-5 days  
- **Phase 3 (Native Voice)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 4 (Polish)**: 1-2 days

**Total: ~1-2 weeks for fully offline iOS D&D game**

## Architecture Strengths
The current architecture is well-designed for your requirements:
- Intelligent fallback system
- Mobile-optimized components
- Voice-first design patterns
- D&D game mechanics in place

The foundation is solid - we just need to complete the implementation.
