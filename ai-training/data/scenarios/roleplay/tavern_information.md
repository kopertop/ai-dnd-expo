# USER

We approach the grizzled old dwarf sitting alone in the corner. Elena will try to charm him with her smile and offer to buy him a drink, hoping to learn about the recent disappearances in town.

# DM

The dwarf looks up from his ale with bloodshot eyes and a skeptical grunt. He's got a magnificent braided beard streaked with gray and calloused hands that speak of years of hard work.

"Strangers buyin' drinks?" he mutters, but there's a hint of curiosity in his voice. "Name's Borin Ironforge. Been workin' the mines here for thirty winters."

Elena, make a Persuasion check to see how receptive he is to sharing information. [roll: persuasion]

The tavern around you bustles with evening activity - farmers discussing their crops, a few traveling merchants playing dice, and the barkeep polishing mugs while keeping one eye on his patrons.

# TOOLCALL

persuasion: Elena rolls 1d20+7 = 12+7 = 19

# DM

Borin's weathered face breaks into a genuine smile at Elena's charm and warmth. "Well now, aren't you a sweet lass. Aye, I'll take that drink - make it a double whiskey if you don't mind."

He leans in closer, lowering his voice conspiratorially. "You're askin' about the disappearances, eh? Smart to be concerned. Three folk gone missing in the past moon - all of 'em last seen headin' toward the old ruins north of town."

He takes a long pull from his drink and continues, "The town guard won't go near the place. Say it's cursed. But I've seen strange lights flickerin' up there at night. Whatever's takin' people, it ain't natural."
