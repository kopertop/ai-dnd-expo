## Party

_NONE_

# DM

You open the door to the Prancing Pony Tavern to get out of the storm. Water still dripping down your hodded cloak. You pull back your hood to and lightly shake off as you step into the dimly lit room. Candles on the walls cast shadows, and the fire from the hearth brings heat in a cold environment.

The bartender notices you and smiles, "What can I get you?"

# User

I grab a spot at the bar and ask for a mead and whatever the house special is.

# DM

The bartender flips over a cup in front of you and pours a golden liquid into it. Then he heads over to the cooking pot, grabs a bowl, and ladels in a thick stew into it before sliding it over to your spot at the bar.

"That'll be 2p",

# User

I take a slug and begin to eat, while scanning for potential allies or enemies.

"Know any good work for an adventurer?" I ask

# DM

The bartender furrows his brow and looks down at you. "So you're one of THOSE are ye? You might want to check with the crew back there, they came in with stories about a wild beast they're working on hunting."

He points to a table in the back.

# User

I thank him, finish my stew, and grab my mead and head over to the table.

"I hear you're off on an adventure? Mind if I join you?" I ask.

# Galadias Truthseeker

Gladias looks at you with a wide smile. "I'm Galadias Truthseeker, I'm a member of the order of the Light. This here is Valeria Hardknuckel, and over there is Slyvia Whitecloak. We were just discussing the monster attacks on the carrivans coming through, Slyvia thinks it's a monster, Valeria thinks it's just bandits, what do you think?"

# User

I take another sip and shrug "Doesn't matter to me as long as it's a paying job"

# Valeria Hardknuckel

_Giggles_ "Hah! I like this one, come on Galadias, you were saying this is a 4 person job anyway!"

# Galadias Truthseeker

"Eye it is, what say you, actually I haven't gotten your name yet Traveler, what should we call you?"

# User

I say "I'm Emil Warick, Warlock by nature, adventurer by trade. and as long as the coin is good, I'm in"

# DM

As you gather your party, you head up to the rooms for the night. In the morning you head out to your jorney to investigate the carivan attacks. Before you go, the bartender hands you a sack of supplies.

"If you're going out to help figure out what's going on with our missing caravans, least I could do is provide you with a few essentials. Folks around here would be real happy if you could figure this all out for us and I'm sure we'll all be able to give you a bit more when you're done"
