# DM

You stand in the heart of Wroat, the capital of Breland, its white stone towers gleaming with dragonshard-lit runes as the sun slants through the windows of the royal audience chamber. The scent of polish and parchment fills the air as guards in burnished plate armor stand motionless beneath the royal banners.

Before you sits King Boranel ir’Wynarn himself, clad not in robes of opulence, but in the worn leather and steel of a soldier-king. His beard is streaked with grey, and his eyes scan you with the same intensity one might use on a battlefield.

“Thaelarion Duskwhisper,” he says, his voice rumbling like distant thunder. “Your name carries weight among the Valenar, and your bow has sung across many fronts.”

He turns to the three others standing beside you:
• Jorek Durnan, a scarred veteran of the Last War, arms crossed and expression unreadable.
• Nymira d’Cannith, fiddling with a metallic orb that quietly hums with elemental power.
• And Bramble, the shifter druid, barefoot and twitching slightly as he sniffs the polished stone floor.

“I summoned you four,” Boranel continues, “not for your charm, but for your… particular talents. The border villages near Xandrar have gone silent. Entire settlements vanish in the night, leaving no sign but scorched stone and whispered screams.”

He steps forward and lowers his voice. “My seers speak of planar residue. Something is stirring beyond the veil—something that does not belong in our world.”

The king meets your gaze, Thaelarion. “You are to travel to the site of the last disappearance. Investigate. Report. Stop it, if you can. You will have the full backing of Breland—so long as you remain discreet. The last thing I need is another war.”

He pauses. “Do you accept this task, ranger of Valenar?”

# User

I step forward, kneel on one knee and bow my head slightly. “I accept the task, my king. If shadows move in your lands, I will see them pierced by arrow and light.”

# King Boranel

He smiles faintly, nodding. “Good. Then may your aim be true.”

He claps once, and a steward steps forward with a large satchel and four small leather pouches. “For your journey,” the king says.

# DM

The steward hands each of you a leather pouch filled with gold and a standard issue Brelish adventuring pack, along with a single vial of healing potion tucked carefully within. Nymira immediately pockets her gold, Bramble sniffs the potion, and Jorek simply grunts with approval.

“Make for the Blackcap Mountains,” the king continues. “There’s a village called Vathirond on the border—the last one to go dark. A House Orien courier station there went silent just two nights past.”

He gestures toward the doors of the audience hall. “Go now. I trust you will return with truth… or fire.”

# User

I nod once more and turn to the others. “Let us see what horrors the veil has spilled into our realm. Breland needs answers, and I intend to find them.”

The party begins to make their exit, boots echoing on the polished stone, the weight of the king’s command heavy but clear.
