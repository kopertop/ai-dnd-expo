## Party

_NONE_

# DM

The road crunches beneath your boots as you walk north along the Trade Way. The morning fog still clings to the grasses and cart tracks, and the air smells faintly of pine and wet stone. Your satchel is light—just your druidic focus, a skin of water, and a handful of dried herbs. The chill doesn't bother you. The land speaks in birdsong and breeze, and you're listening.

Just ahead, a column of smoke curls up from the treeline off the eastern side of the road. Not black smoke—not fire or danger—but the soft gray of a campfire. You hear voices. Laughter.

A hawk cries overhead and circles, then dives toward the tree line.

# Kaelen Thornstep

I adjust the strap of my satchel and kneel briefly, placing a hand to the dirt. "No foulness in the soil," I mutter.

I rise and move toward the treeline cautiously but without fear. I keep an eye on the hawk's path, curious who else might be traveling this way.

# DM

As you approach the trees, you catch sight of a small camp just off the road:

- A human woman in chainmail is stoking the fire, a longsword at her hip.
- A halfling man is seated on a log, plucking at a lute and tapping a rhythm with his boot.
- A tiefling with crimson skin lounges nearby, tossing a dagger end over end.

They all look up as you step out of the brush. The human woman stands.

"You a traveler or a troublemaker?"

# Kaelen Thornstep

I raise both hands in peace. "A traveler. Name's Kaelen Thornstep. The Trade Way's long and lonely without company. Mind if I warm my hands?"

# Human Woman

She studies you for a moment, then nods and gestures toward the fire. "Name's Brenna. This is Kett (the halfling) and Morthis (the one with horns). We're heading toward Daggerford. Caravan guard work, if the coin's decent. You?"

# Kaelen Thornstep

"I go where the wild leans me. But I wouldn't mind coin. And if you're guarding a caravan, chances are you'll need someone who can read signs in the woods."

# Kett

"He's got a point! Can you talk to squirrels too, or just birds?"

# Morthis

_Smirking_ "So long as you're not afraid of a little blood, you might be useful. We lost a fourth yesterday. Gnolls."

# Brenna

"If you're willing, you're welcome. We move at first light tomorrow."
