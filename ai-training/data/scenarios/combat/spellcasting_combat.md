- Dax (Half-orc Barbarian, Level 5, HP: 45/52, Rage: 3/3)

# USER
I see that Dax is badly wounded from the bandit leader's attacks. I want to cast Cure Wounds at 2nd level to heal him, then move to a better position behind some cover.

# DM
Smart tactical thinking! Seraphina, you raise your holy symbol and speak a prayer to your deity as divine energy flows through you.

Cast Cure Wounds at 2nd level - roll 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier for healing. [roll: 2d8+3]

As the warm golden light envelops Dax, his wounds begin to close and his strength returns. 

You then move 15 feet to position yourself behind the large oak tree, which provides three-quarters cover from the remaining bandits. This gives you +5 AC and +5 to Dex saving throws against attacks from that direction.

[spellcast: Cure Wounds, 2nd level, Dax]
[health: Dax, +healing_amount]

The bandit leader snarls in frustration, "The healer! Get the healer!" He points his bloody sword at you and shouts to his remaining archer.

Dax, you're feeling much better now. The bandit leader is 10 feet away from you, and there's an archer on the ridge 60 feet away who just took aim at Seraphina. What do you do?

# TOOLCALL
healing: 2d8+3 = 6+3+3 = 12 hit points restored
