# USER

We're traveling down the forest path when we hear rustling in the bushes. I want to ready my bow and try to spot what's making the noise.

# DM

Good instincts! As you draw your bow and scan the treeline, three goblins burst from the undergrowth with wicked grins and rusty scimitars.

"Surprise!" one shrieks, but your keen elven senses picked up on their movement. Everyone roll for initiative! [roll: initiative]

The lead goblin has a crude leather helm and appears to be shouting orders to the others. They're about 30 feet away and advancing quickly.

# TOOLCALL

initiative: Aria(17+3=20), Thorin(8+1=9), Lyra(15+1=16), Goblin1(12+2=14), Goblin2(6+2=8), Goblin3(11+2=13)

# DM

Initiative order: Aria (20), Lyra (16), Goblin Leader (14), Goblin 2 (13), Thorin (9), Goblin 3 (8)

Aria, you act first! The goblins are 30 feet away, advancing with weapons drawn. What do you do?
