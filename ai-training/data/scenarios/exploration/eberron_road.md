# DM

The road to Vathirond is lined with fog and the distant hum of cicadas. You reach the outskirts of the village just after sunset, the trees casting long, black fingers across abandoned homes. Windows are shattered. Smoke still curls from a few chimneys—but there's no light inside.

As you step past a crooked gate into the center of town, you notice the eerie silence. Even birds and insects have fallen quiet. At the edge of the square, a House Orien courier station stands dark, its wooden door ajar.

# User

I draw my bow and gesture for the others to stay alert. I move quietly toward the courier station and peek inside.

# DM

The interior is a mess of overturned furniture and scattered scroll cases. The air smells of ozone and burnt leather. You spot a splatter of dried blood leading to a trapdoor behind the desk.

Behind you, Bramble sniffs loudly and mutters, "This place stinks of rift-magic... and something else. Wet fur?"

# Nymira d’Cannith

She kneels beside a shattered dragonshard lamp, tapping her finger against it. "Residual energy here. Definitely arcane. This wasn't just a bandit raid."

# Jorek Durnan

He plants himself beside the door, sword halfway drawn. "Trapdoor first, or sweep the rest of the village?"

# User

I crouch beside the trapdoor and run my fingers along the edge. “Let’s check what they were hiding down there. If something’s still inside, I’d rather not leave it at our backs.”

# DM

The trapdoor creaks open to reveal a steep set of stairs descending into darkness. A faint green glow pulses below.

# Bramble

"I’ll go first. I see better in the dark anyway," Bramble grins, his pupils narrowing as he takes a cautious step downward.

# DM

You and your companions descend one by one into what appears to be a subterranean archive—walls lined with crates, scroll tubes, and shelves of labeled files. But at the center of the room is a jagged tear in reality itself, hovering a few feet above the stone floor, pulsing faintly with green energy.

# Nymira d’Cannith

"Planar breach. That’s… that’s impossible. Not without a manifest zone nearby."

# User

I circle the breach slowly, examining the ground for tracks or signs of movement. “Any idea what could have caused this? Looks fresh.”

# DM

The ground near the breach is scorched in a perfect ring, and you find strange, three-toed footprints leading to and from the tear. Whatever came through here, it wasn’t humanoid.

As you kneel to examine further, a sharp crackle fills the air. The breach flares.

# Jorek Durnan

He raises his blade instinctively. “Get ready!”

# DM

Something begins to push through—not fully formed, like a shadow made of smoke and hunger.
