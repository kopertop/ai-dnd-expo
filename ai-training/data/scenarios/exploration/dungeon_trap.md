# USER

The corridor ahead looks suspicious - the stone tiles seem different from the rest. I want to carefully examine the floor for traps before we proceed.

# DM

Excellent caution! The flickering torchlight reveals that several of the stone tiles ahead do indeed look slightly different - they appear to sit just a fraction lower than the surrounding stones.

As you crouch down to examine them more closely, you notice fine seams around the edges and what might be small holes in the mortar between stones. This definitely looks like a trap.

Make an Investigation check to determine the exact nature of the mechanism. [roll: investigation]

The air in the tomb is musty and cold, carrying the faint scent of ancient incense mixed with something less pleasant. Gareth, you can also assist if you'd like to help spot details Zara might miss.

# TOOLCALL

investigation: Zara rolls 1d20+5 = 14+5 = 19

# DM

With your practiced eye for danger, you quickly identify this as a classic pressure plate trap. The lowered tiles will trigger when sufficient weight is applied - likely around 50 pounds or more.

You can see tiny dart holes in the walls on either side, positioned at about knee and chest height. The mechanism appears to be spring-loaded, and you estimate it would fire multiple poisoned darts across the 10-foot corridor.

However, you also notice that the trap mechanism looks old and might not be perfectly maintained. The tiles seem to stick slightly, suggesting the springs may have weakened over time.

You have several options:

1. Attempt to disarm the trap with your thieves' tools [roll: thieves_tools]
2. Try to wedge the pressure plates to prevent activation
3. Jump across the trapped area (requires Athletics check)
4. Find another route (if one exists)
