# USER
We enter the magic shop looking for spell components and maybe a magical item or two. Finn is particularly interested in anything that might help with his spell casting, while Kaia wants to see if there are any items that complement her draconic heritage.

# DM
The shop's bell chimes melodically as you enter, and you're immediately struck by the organized chaos of magical items covering every surface. Crystalline orbs pulse with inner light, spell components fill countless jars and bottles, and the air shimmers with residual magical energy.

Behind the counter stands Mystara, a middle-aged half-elf with silver-streaked hair and knowing eyes that seem to appraise you both instantly.

"Welcome, welcome!" she says warmly. "I can sense the arcane energies flowing through both of you. Let me show you some items that might interest practicing spellcasters."

She gestures to several items on the counter:

**For Finn:**
- **Wand of Magic Missiles** (uncommon): 7 charges, regains 1d6+1 at dawn. 3 missiles per charge. *Price: 300gp*
- **Pearl of Power** (uncommon): Recover one 3rd level spell slot per long rest. *Price: 400gp*
- **Spellbook of Useful Cantrips**: Contains Mage Hand, Light, and Prestidigitation. *Price: 50gp*

**For Kaia:**
- **Dragon Scale Amulet** (uncommon): +1 to spell attack rolls, matches your draconic ancestry. *Price: 250gp*
- **Cloak of Elvenkind** (uncommon): Advantage on Stealth, disadvantage on attacks against you. *Price: 500gp*

"All prices are negotiable for serious practitioners of the Art," Mystara adds with a wink. "I also buy interesting spell components and magical curiosities."
