# DM

The wind howls as you push aside a curtain of hanging moss and duck into the mouth of a narrow cave. The air is immediately colder, and the muffled sound of dripping water echoes from somewhere deep within.

Behind you, the last rays of twilight fade, swallowed by the yawning mouth of stone. Ahead? Only darkness.

A fetid scent clings to the walls—earth and mold, but something older, too. Foul. Alien.

You step forward, your boots crunching against loose gravel. A carved stone archway, half-swallowed by stalactites, marks the descent. Faint glyphs shimmer with a sickly green glow, pulsing like a heartbeat.

**This is it. The first breath of the Underdark.**

You hear a whisper that may be wind… or may not. Your artifact pulses—hot against your skin. Not in warning. In recognition.

A path leads downward, deeper into the dark.

# User

I grip the artifact tight and look down the path. Do I hear anything?

# DM

Perception check result: 14.

You catch the sound of movement—scuttling, scraping. Then a faint *click*—like stone tapping stone. Not alone.

A fork appears: one tunnel pulses with blue light, the other sinks into black silence. The artifact pulls faintly left.

# User

I move cautiously toward the glowing tunnel, eldritch energy at the ready.

# DM

You descend into the glow. Walls narrow. Damp air thickens. You find a bone-masked figure carving runes into stone.

# Bone Mask Figure

"You shouldn't be here. They will smell your surface blood."

# User

"I'm not here for them. I’m here for answers. Maybe we can help each other."

# Bone Mask Figure

"Help? No. Survive? Perhaps. Follow the blood trail before it fades. The first gate is already waking."

He vanishes into shadow. A rune chip lands at your feet.

# DM

As you move on, the path takes you to a stone bridge. A figure stands guard, glaive in hand.

# Kael Thornhook

“Stop right there. Only the strong pass deeper. If you want my bridge, fight for it. No blood, no bond.”

# DM

# DM

You and Kael pass through twisted tunnels until they open into a sunken vault filled with floating glyphs—circles, shifting letters, runes in motion.

# Kael Thornhook

“Drow magic. Puzzle lock. Either solve it or trigger half a dozen traps.”

## ✦ Encounter Options

> A. **Solve the Glyph Puzzle** (INT or WIS-based check)

> C. **Let Kael Try** (chaos option)

# DM

The air hums. The glyphs spin slowly, waiting. The artifact pulses—perhaps it remembers these runes.

**What do you do?**
